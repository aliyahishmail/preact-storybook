It was fascinating how the chapter connected the dots between the theoretical aspects of UX design that I've been learning and their practical application in the enterprise context.\n\nThe chapter began by emphasizing the crucial role of user interfaces in enterprise applications. I related to this as it solidified the idea that all the principles and methodologies I've been studying in the UXD program are ultimately geared toward improving user interactions with complex business systems. This practicality is something new and fascinating that I was excited to explore and read further. My initial reaction to the reading was the main question, “What is SAP?” This felt concerning because the reading stated that SAP is, “de facto standard software in many industries” (Obert). As I aspiring UX Developer, I found it interesting how I had never learned or heard of SAF before, considering it is industry standard. \n\nOne aspect that resonated with me was the discussion of the unique challenges and requirements of enterprise UI design. The need for consistency, scalability, and adaptability makes logical sense in the context of large organizations, and it aligns with the user-centred design principles I've been taught in UX100/200 Design Thinking. I enjoyed reading about those principles applied in the real world. The reading also stressed the importance of understanding user's roles and tasks within the enterprise which, I agreed with.  As a junior UX Designer, I believe that designing interfaces that cater to user’s specific needs and workflows is essential. Furthermore, the introduction to SAP UI frameworks like SAP Fiori and SAPUI5 was informative. I was able to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application and learning about these industry-specific tools was valuable.\n\nOverall, “SAP UI Frameworks for Enterprise Developers\" has not only expanded my horizons but has also strengthened my passion for UX design and coding. It has given me a glimpse into open software design and enterprise UI design. Including the valuable role it plays in the success of businesses. One aspect that I think should be incorporated into the UX program is knowledge of open-source technology and software. The reading mentioned that it's increasingly popular and could be valuable for other students to learn about. I'm excited to continue exploring this topic on my own and in the course, while applying it to what I've learned in my academic journey and future endeavours in the User Experience Design program. \n\n\n\n\n\n"],"names":["_createMdxContent","props","_components","_provideComponents","Meta","_missingMdxReference","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","MDXContent","MDXLayout","id","component"],"mappings":"mNAGA,SAASA,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,MAAMC,EAAc,OAAO,OAAO,CAChC,EAAG,IACH,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,IACR,EAAKC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EAAG,CAAC,KAAAG,CAAI,EAAIF,EACrD,OAAKE,GAAMC,EAAqB,OAAQ,EAAI,EACrCC,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACD,EAAMJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC9B,SAAU,CAACM,EAAKJ,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,4BACR,CAAA,EAAG,GAAG,CACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKN,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,iBACJ,SAAU,gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMM,EAAKN,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,8DACJ,SAAU,8DACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMM,EAAKN,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,iBACJ,SAAU,gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMM,EAAKN,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,kVACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMM,EAAKN,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,guBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMM,EAAKN,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,+3BACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMM,EAAKN,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,qtBAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASO,EAAWR,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASS,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEP,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOS,EAAYF,EAAKE,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAET,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUO,EAAKR,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAkBC,CAAK,CAC/B,CAEA,SAASI,EAAqBM,EAAIC,EAAW,CAC3C,MAAM,IAAI,MAAM,aAAeA,EAAY,YAAc,UAAY,KAAOD,EAAK,oEAAoE,CACvJ"}
