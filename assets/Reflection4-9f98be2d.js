`,e(t.p,{children:"In the reading by Somesh Kesarla Suresh, I had several new thoughts, ideas and reactions that I believe are valuable. My initial reaction to the article was one of empathy. As a UX student, I've encountered similar challenges in design projects where inconsistencies in design elements have caused confusion among members. For example, in a group project, some members would use bright colours while our intended palette was pastel colours.  It was reassuring to see that these issues are not unique to academic settings but are real-world challenges faced by designers in startups."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"I agreed with the author on the importance of a cohesive and standardized design system component, such as checkboxes. The article effectively highlights the challenges that can arise when a design system becomes fragmented, with different teams implementing checkboxes inconsistently. As a UX student, I recognize that consistency in design elements is crucial for creating a seamless user experience. It ensures that users can easily understand and interact with the interface, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"The article stated that, “organizations must prioritize Design Systems as the main project to boost product development workflow, user experience, and revenue” (Suresh). While I agree that this is an important factor, I also believe that there are other components that need to be completed to ensure a good project outcome. For example, I would argue that having proper workflows such as a waterfall or agile project planning is important, a proper budget, goals or mission should also be established as well as a design system to have a successful outcome."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"However, I also found myself in partial disagreement with the article in terms of the proposed solution. The author suggests creating a centralized team responsible for checkbox design but it could slow down the development process. While I agree that having clear guidelines and standards is essential, I believe that a more collaborative approach involving cross-functional teams might be more effective. This would allow for a broader range of perspectives and expertise in the design process."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"In conclusion, Somesh’s article on redesigning a fragmented checkbox design system component resonated with my experiences as a UX student. While I agreed with the importance of consistency in design systems, I also questioned some aspects. I also gained valuable insights into the significance of conducting design audits. This article has helped me further my knowledge and understanding of design systems."})]})}function y(s={}){const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},i(),s.components);return t?e(t,Object.assign({},s,{children:e(n,s)})):n(s)}export{y as default};
