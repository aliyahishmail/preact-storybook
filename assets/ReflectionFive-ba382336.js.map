In \"Emerging Technologies: The Future of Low Code,\" Mark explores the evolving landscape of low-code development platforms and their potential impact on the world of software development. The article displays the significance of low-code platforms and how it can streamline the software development process. It highlights the vital role low-code platforms can play in transforming traditional software development.\n\nOne of the agreements I had with the article is the notion that low-code platforms can significantly accelerate the development of software applications. The author highlights how these platforms empower individuals with limited coding experience to create functional applications, thereby increasing efficiency and productivity. I agree with this perspective, as it aligns with the overarching goal of user experience design, which is to create user-friendly and accessible applications. I have experienced many projects in university that have a focus on equity, diversity and inclusion, and I believe these projects could benefit from low-code solutions. As Mark stated, “Low code has emerged in the last five years as one potential tool in both enabling business transformation and scaling these initiatives cost-effectively over time” (Driver). I agree with the article's emphasis on the potential cost savings associated with low-code development. By reducing the need for extensive coding expertise and expediting the development process, organizations can achieve a more cost-effective approach to software creation.\n\nWhile the article promotes low-code platforms, I think it's crucial to acknowledge potential drawbacks. One area of disagreement is the article's view of low-code platforms replacing traditional development entirely. While low code can expedite certain aspects of development, it may not be suitable for highly complex, customized applications that require intricate coding. I think applications with a high volume of users such as the registration page for courses at Laurier would need highly developed software to handle lots of users at one time. I argue that it's essential to strike a balance between the convenience of low code and the precision of traditional development.\n\nOne of the key takeaways is the concept of \"democratizing\" application development through low-code platforms. This idea resonates with the principle of inclusive design in user experience, as it encourages a broader range of individuals to contribute to the development of accessible and user-friendly applications. Additionally, I gained insights into the potential for low-code platforms to bridge the gap between IT and business departments, fostering better collaboration and understanding. This aligns with the importance of effective communication and collaboration in UX design, as it often involves working closely with various stakeholders.\n"],"names":["_createMdxContent","props","_components","_provideComponents","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","MDXContent","MDXLayout"],"mappings":"obAIA,SAASA,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,MAAMC,EAAc,OAAO,OAAO,CAChC,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,EAAG,GACJ,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACzC,OAAOG,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACC,EAAKC,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,6BACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMD,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,kBACJ,SAAU,iBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,WACJ,SAAU,UACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,iBACJ,SAAU,gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,8gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,smCACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,0qBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,4oBAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASM,EAAWP,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASQ,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEN,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOQ,EAAYH,EAAKG,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAER,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUK,EAAKN,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAkBC,CAAK,CAC/B"}
