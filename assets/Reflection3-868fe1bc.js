`,e(t.p,{children:`In the reading by Aleksi Koivu called "Technology Agnostic Design Systems," I couldn't help but draw parallels to my own experiences as a third-year UX student. Koivu's discussion of technology-agnostic design systems resonates with what I've been learning in the User Experience Design program. One of the main concepts that I learned from this reading was the importance of design systems. The article stated, “organizations must prioritize Design Systems as the main project to boost product development workflow, user experience, and revenue” (Koivu). The benefits of using a design system highlight why and how this would be a crucial factor and show that the time needed to create a system is worth it.`}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"I agree with Koivu's argument for technology-agnostic design systems. In today's fast-paced digital world, it's crucial for UX designers to create solutions that can adapt to various platforms and technologies. Designing with a specific technology in mind can quickly become outdated, limiting the usability and longevity of a product. For example, constantly relying on one software or program can be dangerous and limiting. By separating design from technology, we can ensure that our user experiences remain consistent and relevant across different devices and contexts. This is especially important with the different types of brands and devices available to people now such as Apple, Android, Samsung, Dell, etc."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"Moreover, Koivu's emphasis on flexibility and adaptability aligns with my experiences in real-world school projects. I've noticed that when we design with a focus on specific technologies, we often run into challenges when new technologies emerge. This is similar to when I design all my case studies using one software and the website hosting is not compatible with such designs or files. A technology-agnostic approach would allow for future-proof and designs would respond more effectively to changes in the digital landscape."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"However, I did have some disagreements with the reading. While the idea of technology-agnostic design systems is appealing, I've encountered situations where clients have strong preferences for specific technologies. For example, while working for a non-profit, they only had access to Canva Pro for the team. However, I need to use a premium version of Flourish, a graphing site. In such cases, convincing them to embrace a more flexible approach was challenging. Additionally, it might require more time and resources to develop the design elements, which could have been a concern if the project had a tight deadline or limited budget. In conclusion, Koivu's article has provided me with valuable insights into the world of UX design. I appreciate the emphasis on technology-agnostic design systems and their potential to create more robust and adaptable user experiences. As I continue my studies and eventually enter the professional UX field, I plan to keep this concept in mind."})]})}function v(i={}){const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},o(),i.components);return t?e(t,Object.assign({},i,{children:e(n,i)})):n(i)}export{v as default};
