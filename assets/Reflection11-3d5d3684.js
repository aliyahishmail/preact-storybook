`,e(t.p,{children:"Choosing between Sketch and Figma for developing design systems is a key decision that often influences the design workflow. As a third-year UX student, I have had the opportunity to explore and engage with both platforms extensively. This practice-based reflection aims to delve into utilizing Sketch and Figma in the context of design systems, drawing from personal experiences and observations. By examining the strengths and limitations of each tool, I aim to provide a thoughtful analysis that serves as a practical exploration of the tools and offers valuable insights for fellow UX designers."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"When comparing both platforms, I believe that Figma is easier to use and build a small library of components for a design library. The interface is easy to use and access. Users can 2access Figma using the desktop app or browser with full editing capabilities. However, Sketch is a paid app only that needs to be installed on a Mac desktop with no browser editing abilities. Students without the paid version face limitations in terms of accessing the full set of collaborative features and the ability to edit. The interface of Sketch is also much more detailed with more features. The features and ability to create styles for all components are great features for a large company with a big design system. Sketch can organize and handle multiple components, organizing them efficiently. However, there is a big learning curve with SKetch that does not make it practical for UX students to use. Although, both interfaces use purple text and borders to indicate design components which makes it easier for users to understand vector shapes versus assets. A great feature of Figma is that it has a massive design community of free files filled with design variants and components that allow users to add them to their designs."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"While using both platforms, I found it easier to use Sketch when switching between different variants of design elements. On Sketch, you can see a preview with a little thumbnail of the different options. On Figma, you can only see the text names, making it hard to quickly switch between variants. In addition, Sketch organizes all the components, colours, and text styles into different pages, while Figma only separates components based on artboards and frames, using only the vector elements."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"One of the challenges posed by using design systems and components as a student is the uneven distribution of responsibilities when it comes to creating a design system within a group project. Design systems can play a crucial role in ensuring consistency and cohesiveness across various elements of a group project, making them an essential aspect of collaborative design efforts. However, the burden of constructing different components by only one student can lead to an unfair and imbalanced dynamic within the group. This issue not only raises concerns about the equitable distribution of workload but also emphasizes the importance of promoting shared ownership and collaborative decision-making in UX education. For instance, I have included a few images below of style guides I created in Canva. It shows which colours, fonts, icons and other items I created for our group project for UX200, UX103, and UX205. This was used to help my team members use the same colours and imagery for our projects and helped to create a cohesive look when using these items in our portfolios. However, I was the only group member that worked on the style guide. In addition, not all my team members used the correct colour codes. Some of my classmates used similar colours but were too lazy to copy and paste the correct HEX codes into our design files. Therefore, while I believe that having a design library is efficient, it poses some issues when there are no strict guidelines requiring designers to follow them. Overall, I would recommend Figma for beginner designers and Sketch for senior UX designers who need to build and manage large design systems."})]})}function w(i={}){const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},o(),i.components);return t?e(t,Object.assign({},i,{children:e(n,i)})):n(i)}export{w as default};
