Drawing on a series of reflections, this paper discusses aspects of design systems, including their importance, challenges, practical applications, and their role in User Experience Design. Each reflection throughout the course contributes unique perspectives, both in agreement and disagreement with using design systems. This paper aims to provide a complete understanding of design systems and insights into the implications for my academic/professional journey.\n\n### Design Systems in UX Design\n\t\n    Design systems have become an increasingly popular topic in User Experience Design (UX). They offer a structured approach to creating consistent, efficient, and scalable digital interfaces and experiences. In this summative paper, I will discuss various aspects of design systems, drawing upon a series of reflections written throughout UX490. These reflections highlight different viewpoints, the importance of design systems, their practical applications, tools, and potential challenges. By putting together these insights, I will provide a view of design systems, emphasizing the need for adaptability and new concepts learned. \n\t\n    The first reflection emphasizes the importance of design systems in UX design. It states that design systems streamline the design process, making it more efficient. As stated, \"To convince teammates why a design system is crucial, I would start by explaining how a design system can streamline a design process, ensure consistency, and save time\" (Reflection One). The concept of time-saving and future investment is similar to the idea that organizing a room may take time initially but saves time when searching for items in the long run. This reflection highlights the central role of design systems in enhancing the user experience of a product.\n\t\n    The second reflection focuses on enterprise user interfaces and their relationship to UX design. It highlights the challenges and requirements specific to enterprise UI design. This reflection states, \"The need for consistency, scalability, and adaptability makes logical sense in the context of large organizations, and it aligns with the user-centred design principles I've been taught in UX100/200 Design Thinking\" (Reflection Two). The significance of understanding users' roles and tasks within enterprises is key, demonstrating how theory and practice merge in the enterprise context. Reflection Three explores technology-agnostic design systems and their relevance in today's fast-paced digital world. It reflects the need for flexibility and adaptability in UX design. The reflection states, \"In today's fast-paced digital world, it's crucial for UX designers to create solutions that can adapt to various platforms and technologies\" (Reflection Three). I learned the importance of separating design from technology to ensure consistent and relevant user experiences across different devices and contexts.\n\nThe fourth reflection delves into the integration of low-code and no-code platforms with design systems. It aligns with the broader trend of low-code development and its potential to accelerate software development. As mentioned, \"The author highlights how these platforms empower individuals with limited coding experience to create functional applications, thereby increasing efficiency and productivity\" (Reflection Five). However, I raise the question of creating a balance between low code's convenience and traditional coding's precision. Reflection Eight emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistency within a design system, aligning with UX principles. It stresses the need for UX students to remain adaptable and open to alternative tools in the ever-changing software industry. The reflection states, \"While Sketch is undoubtedly a powerful application, it's crucial to acknowledge that the software landscape is constantly evolving\" (Reflection Eight). This perspective encourages me and other students to stay updated on industry trends and explore various tools. The final reflections discuss Figma and its potential to streamline the design-to-development process and collaboration. It highlights the significance of collaboration between designers and developers, emphasizing the need for close cooperation in efficient UX design. However, I also learned about the learning curve and the potential distraction from core design principles that Figma may cause. \n\nFor design systems, the significance of consistency, efficiency, and scalability extends beyond user experiences and interfaces. Take, for instance, a website like Monitech, a provider of industrial electronic solutions. The use of design systems ensures that such platforms offer a consistent and intuitive user experience, making it easier for businesses to navigate, browse products, and complete transactions seamlessly. A well-structured design system can ensure that B2B e-commerce platforms maintain uniformity and harmony in their user interfaces, making it easier for businesses to navigate complex purchasing processes. It can also help new employees of a business make the purchasing process easier for their company/job. This increases user satisfaction and reduces bounce rates on a site. These design systems provide a structured framework for organizing the website's elements, such as navigation menus, search bars, product listings, and checkout processes. By maintaining a consistent design language and user interface components, businesses can enhance the experience for clients, ultimately building trust and facilitating successful B2B transactions. Design systems in B2B e-commerce simplify the process of presenting product information and ensuring a professional, reliable, and efficient platform that meets the specific needs of business clients.\n\nWhile design systems offer numerous advantages, they are not without their disadvantages. One significant drawback is the initial time and effort required to create a design system. Building a complete system that covers all design elements and components can be time-consuming, especially when starting from scratch. This investment might not be feasible for small or strict time-constrained projects. These projects would require a project management team and using an agile approach would benefit the design team. Additionally, design systems require ongoing maintenance and updates. As new design trends and technologies occur, the system must evolve to stay relevant. Without proper maintenance, inconsistencies and usability issues can occur. This is challenging as UX is still new for some businesses and having a full-time UX Designer may not be feasible for all small organizations. Another disadvantage is the potential for over standardization and repetition. Design systems promote consistency, but excessive standardization can stop creativity and innovation. Designers may feel constrained by rigid guidelines, limiting their ability to experiment and create unique user experiences. This can lead to a \"cookie-cutter\" feel in designs, where everything looks the same, potentially reducing a brand's identity. While this may be necessary for some businesses such as banks as the need for simple, reliable and trustworthy designs is needed; other companies such as skincare brands need to innovate to stay relevant and be top of mind for consumers as the options of brands are limitless. Design systems can also become chaotic if not properly organized. As a design system grows and expands, managing a large number of components, guidelines, and assets can become complex. Without effective organization, finding the right element or guideline can be a time-consuming task. Without proper organization of a system, productivity can decrease and make the system less user-friendly for employees/designers. The last challenge I discovered with design systems is convincing an organization and stakeholders to implement a design system. Some senior employees may be resistant to change and reluctant to adopt a new system. They might also not believe that a UX designer is needed with budget constraints or limitations. To overcome this challenge using visual examples of other companies who have adopted this process would be beneficial including data and statistics. \n\nIn conclusion, the exploration of design systems through the lens of ten reflective insights has provided a great understanding of their significance in the field of user experience design. The consistent theme across my reflections is the central role that design systems play in enhancing efficiency, maintaining design consistency, and fostering collaboration. While they offer multiple advantages, it is essential to acknowledge potential disadvantages such as the investment of time and effort, over-standardization, organizational challenges, and potential resistance within teams. As a UX student, these insights have improved my perspective on design systems, emphasizing their real-world relevance and adaptability. The world of user experience design is dynamic, and design systems remain an essential tool for promoting consistency, collaboration, and user satisfaction. As I continue my academic and professional journey, these reflections will serve as a guide, reinforcing the core principles of design systems for better user experiences. \n\n\n\n\n\n"],"names":["_createMdxContent","props","_components","_provideComponents","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","MDXContent","MDXLayout"],"mappings":"obAIA,SAASA,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,MAAMC,EAAc,OAAO,OAAO,CAChC,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,EAAG,IACH,GAAI,IACL,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACzC,OAAOG,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACC,EAAKC,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,8BACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMD,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,qDACJ,SAAU,wDACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,WACJ,SAAU,UACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,kiBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,8BACJ,SAAU,6BACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,ynBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,4oBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,2lCACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,28CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,81CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,i7EACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,+hCAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASM,EAAWP,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASQ,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEN,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOQ,EAAYH,EAAKG,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAER,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUK,EAAKN,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAkBC,CAAK,CAC/B"}
