`,e(t.p,{children:'In the reading by Piyuesh Kumar, titled "Merging Low-Code & No-Code with Design Systems," I found both points of agreement and disagreement, along with real-world connections. One key concept that stood out to me was the idea of "visual development" through low-code and no-code platforms, which empowers designers to create functional prototypes and production-ready applications with minimal coding knowledge. As stated in the reading, “Using low code development tools, teams have become more efficient in building visual tools without substantial coding. Being a visual development approach allows a UX designer to automate steps of the application lifecycle” (Kumar). I thought that this concept challenged traditional notions of the designer-developer divide and emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the UX field. Additionally, I learned about the critical role of design systems in these platforms, serving as a foundation for consistency and collaboration. Understanding how design systems can seamlessly integrate with low-code and no-code tools is a valuable concept that I intend to explore further in my studies and future projects.'}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"One aspect of the article that I agreed with was the emphasis on the growing importance of low-code and no-code platforms in the field of UX design. I agree with Kumar's article that these platforms can significantly expedite the development process. As a student, I have often encountered tight deadlines for projects, and the ability to streamline design and development through low-code and no-code tools is interesting."}),`
`,e(t.p,{children:"Additionally, Kumar's discussion on the integration of design systems within these platforms aligns with my coursework. In some group projects, we make a style guide to help us keep colours and icons consistent. Similarly, a design system would help further this concept for larger projects. These systems could not only maintain design consistency but also enhance collaboration among team members, a concept I find invaluable as I work on lots of group projects in the UXD program. However, I  argue with Kumar's assertion that low-code platforms could potentially replace traditional coding skills in the UX field. While these platforms are useful, I believe that a solid foundation in coding remains a crucial skill for UX designers. Understanding the intricacies of coding allows designers to have a more comprehensive grasp of the possibilities and limitations of digital products. As a student, I've been encouraged to develop coding skills as seen through the Web design courses. In addition, this seems similar to the ongoing discussion about AI replacing designers or UX jobs. Similarly, I agree that AI is useful, however, it will not be able to replicate a UX designer’s ability to create and design using empathy. This argument can be applied to no-code platforms as I think programmers and coders are vital to the job market. In conclusion, Piyuesh Kumar's article presents compelling arguments and insights. While I agree with the potential benefits of these platforms, I also maintain reservations about their ability to replace coding skills entirely."})]})}function b(o={}){const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},n(),o.components);return t?e(t,Object.assign({},o,{children:e(i,o)})):i(o)}export{b as default};
