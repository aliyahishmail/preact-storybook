Drawing from Yash’s extensive experience in the field, the interview shed light on various topics including computer programming, design systems, and his role as a Product Manager. This paper delves into the influence of AI on coding and development, career prospects in computer science, and strategies for securing a full-time job post-graduation. \n\nTo begin the interview, I asked, “What’s a typical day in life working as a product manager? A typical day of Yash Shah is a blend of various responsibilities. His role revolves around managing design systems to ensure the seamless development of cybersecurity solutions. Each workday, Yash begins by diving into a flood of emails, addressing queries, and responding to team members, stakeholders, and designers. He employs an Agile approach and oversees tasks and components to maintain project momentum. Ensuring quality and collaboration, Yash ensures that designers have conducted peer reviews, promoting excellence in design. Daily stand-up meetings with his dedicated team keep everyone aligned and quarterly meetings to ensure goals are being met. To get a better understanding of a design system, I asked Yash to define the term and explain why it is important in the context of user experience design. I learned that a design system is a blueprint that guides the visual and interactive elements of a digital product, ensuring consistency and coherence in its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). It also plays a pivotal role in streamlining the user's interaction with a website or mobile app. Yash gave a great example, “Consider a scenario where a website incorporates a variety of buttons and dropdown menus, without a well-defined design system, these elements may lack consistency and intuitive design.” I asked him to provide an example from his experience and he explained how using a world icon to both open a browser and reveal a dropdown menu for selecting countries can lead to cognitive overload for users. This led to his explanation of the importance of integrating universal icons and consistent design principles, similar to those found in video games. Furthermore, I learned that design systems save developers time by providing pre-built components, typically ranging from 10 to 15, that can be easily accessed from a library, reducing the need to recreate elements from scratch and ensuring a cohesive and efficient user experience.\n\t\nTo get a better understanding of Yash’s job experience, I asked him about the current design systems at McAfee. I learned that McAfee offers mobile features and apps available on various devices, including iPads and smartphones. In this scenario, he ensures that UI elements like buttons maintain a consistent appearance across all platforms. By implementing a robust design system, McAfee's design team can effortlessly standardize the visual components of buttons, ensuring they look and behave consistently on iPads and mobile devices. Moreover, he explained how McAfee's practice of booking meetings to explore and deepen the understanding of design systems further exemplifies its commitment to enhancing efficiency and collaboration, as it allows team members to align their efforts and expertise. Focusing on the course learning outcomes, I expressed my interest in learning about the challenges posed by autonomous teams and micro front ends in maintaining project consistency and standards. He illustrated through his experiences at McAfee that one of the prominent hurdles encountered is inconsistent process flows across various teams. McAfee's autonomous teams often adapt processes that suit their specific needs, which can result in research-intensive endeavours. In their work on Figma projects, they've encountered the issue of files growing to a size where they become too large, leading to crashes and loading problems. Additionally, process-related concerns extend to the structure and organization of design files, where maintaining consistency becomes an issue. To address these challenges, McAfee employs project managers who enforce guidelines and best practices, specifying the \"do's and don'ts\" of how projects should be structured. This proactive approach aims to ensure projects are sped up but the quality remains the same. One concern I had with computer programming was the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to write and produce code. I expressed these concerns to Yash and he stated that it simplifies the development process, making it more accessible and efficient. Prominent examples he gave were Apple and Google's design systems and how AI can effectively assist in creating standardized components, eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel for common UI elements. He advised me that tools like ChatGPT are invaluable for automating repetitive and mundane tasks, such as generating design tokens for a system. However, while AI excels at these tasks, it falls short in areas where human qualities like user research and empathy are essential. He also noted that T=there's a cautionary note as well, “Once a machine learns our code, it can potentially replicate it, raising concerns about intellectual property and uniqueness at McAfee.” I concluded that while AI undoubtedly enhances coding efficiency, developers must balance between leveraging its capabilities and ensuring proper human and user-centred design research is done. \n\nIn the interview discussion with Yash Shah, his insights were valuable on the question of whether to focus on building computer science and programming skills in a competitive job market. Yash emphasized that while there is a significant presence of front-end developers, the most coveted or sought out professionals in the field are those with a multifaceted skill set. Specifically, he highlighted the importance of front-end developers who can seamlessly combine design proficiency with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a foundational knowledge of frameworks like React. Moreover, he stressed that understanding basic UX design principles is beneficial and essential in today's landscape. He assured me that puring a degree in UX Design was a smart option. It also explained how to grasp concepts like cognitive overload and leveraging these principles to distinguish oneself from other applicants. Ultimately, I was able to conclude that in order to stand out in the competitive job market, having skills in multiple areas is necessary. Continuing on the topic of jobs, Yash provided insights on post-graduation career strategies that are invaluable for me as an aspiring professional. To secure a full-time job after graduating, he recommends a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, focusing on enhancing my portfolio was key. Additionally, considering internship positions is a smart move, as it provides practical experience and networking opportunities. Yash emphasized the importance of initiating the job search early, suggesting that I start looking for positions right now to get a head start in a competitive job market. Particularly, he suggested exploring opportunities in banks and insurance companies, where there's a focus on redoing finance applications. I concluded that by aligning my efforts with these recommendations, I can maximize my chance of securing a full-time job after graduation. During the interview with Yash, I also asked him to share some insights regarding the hiring process at McAfee. He explained that McAfee typically conducts two to three rounds of interviews. The initial round involves a conversation, followed by a second round with the hiring manager. Notably, the third round, which involves several designers, is of a technical nature, emphasizing the importance of hiring individuals who are the right fit for the team. Yash emphasized that skills can be taught, but team dynamics play a critical role in successful hires. The interview process at McAfee involves behavioral questions, often based on real-life cases, such as discussing a time when a disagreement had to be resolved. Technical challenges like designing a login screen in a limited time frame are also used to assess candidates. Additionally, the concept of cognitive overload is incorporated into the questioning. Reference checks and background checks are also standard procedures in the hiring process. Moreover, he mentioned that this hiring process, with three to four rounds, is consistent with that of many other companies. To explore job opportunities, he suggested platforms like workintech.ca, LinkedIn, Laurier job postings, and reaching out to WLU alumni who work at the same company for insider insights or references. \n\nIn conclusion, the interview with Yash highlighted the value of human-centered design in the ever-evolving tech industry. While AI continues to advance, he enforced that it cannot replace the authentic, empathetic approach of designing with users in mind. Designs rooted in thorough research and a deep understanding of human needs and behaviors remain important and are what I should be focusing on. His insights were a reminder that even as technology progresses, the ability to solve genuine pain points will always be in high demand, ensuring that a UX degree is useful. Overall, the interview helped develop my understanding of design systems and prepared me for the application process after graduation.  \n\n"],"names":["_createMdxContent","props","_components","_provideComponents","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","MDXContent","MDXLayout"],"mappings":"obAIA,SAASA,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,MAAMC,EAAc,OAAO,OAAO,CAChC,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,EAAG,GACJ,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACzC,OAAOG,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACC,EAAKC,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,mBACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMD,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,8CACJ,SAAU,6CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,iBACJ,SAAU,gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,oeACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,whEACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,+6FACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,8rGACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,usBAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASM,EAAWP,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASQ,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEN,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOQ,EAAYH,EAAKG,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAER,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUK,EAAKN,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAkBC,CAAK,CAC/B"}
