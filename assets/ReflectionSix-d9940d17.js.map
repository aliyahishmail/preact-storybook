One key concept that stood out to me was the idea of \"visual development\" through low-code and no-code platforms, which empowers designers to create functional prototypes and production-ready applications with minimal coding knowledge. As stated in the reading, “Using low code development tools, teams have become more efficient in building visual tools without substantial coding. Being a visual development approach allows a UX designer to automate steps of the application lifecycle” (Kumar). I thought that this concept challenged traditional notions of the designer-developer divide and emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the UX field. Additionally, I learned about the critical role of design systems in these platforms, serving as a foundation for consistency and collaboration. Understanding how design systems can seamlessly integrate with low-code and no-code tools is a valuable concept that I intend to explore further in my studies and future projects.\n\nOne aspect of the article that I agreed with was the emphasis on the growing importance of low-code and no-code platforms in the field of UX design. I agree with Kumar's article that these platforms can significantly expedite the development process. As a student, I have often encountered tight deadlines for projects, and the ability to streamline design and development through low-code and no-code tools is interesting. \n\nAdditionally, Kumar's discussion on the integration of design systems within these platforms aligns with my coursework. In some group projects, we make a style guide to help us keep colours and icons consistent. Similarly, a design system would help further this concept for larger projects. These systems could not only maintain design consistency but also enhance collaboration among team members, a concept I find invaluable as I work on lots of group projects in the UXD program. However, I  argue with Kumar's assertion that low-code platforms could potentially replace traditional coding skills in the UX field. While these platforms are useful, I believe that a solid foundation in coding remains a crucial skill for UX designers. Understanding the intricacies of coding allows designers to have a more comprehensive grasp of the possibilities and limitations of digital products. As a student, I've been encouraged to develop coding skills as seen through the Web design courses. In addition, this seems similar to the ongoing discussion about AI replacing designers or UX jobs. Similarly, I agree that AI is useful, however, it will not be able to replicate a UX designer’s ability to create and design using empathy. This argument can be applied to no-code platforms as I think programmers and coders are vital to the job market. In conclusion, Piyuesh Kumar's article presents compelling arguments and insights. While I agree with the potential benefits of these platforms, I also maintain reservations about their ability to replace coding skills entirely. \n"],"names":["_createMdxContent","props","_components","_provideComponents","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","MDXContent","MDXLayout"],"mappings":"obAIA,SAASA,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,MAAMC,EAAc,OAAO,OAAO,CAChC,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,EAAG,GACJ,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACzC,OAAOG,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACC,EAAKC,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,4BACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMD,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,iBACJ,SAAU,gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,8BACJ,SAAU,6BACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,iBACJ,SAAU,gBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,kpCACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,yaACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,EAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,kiDAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASM,EAAWP,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASQ,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEN,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOQ,EAAYH,EAAKG,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAER,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUK,EAAKN,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAkBC,CAAK,CAC/B"}
