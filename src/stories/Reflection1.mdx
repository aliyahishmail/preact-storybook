# REFLECTION ONE 
## Design System for Enhanced Collaboration and Workflow 

### Aliyah Ishmail 

The reading by Maghsoodi. K inspired a few new ideas regarding UX and design systems. The first concept that I thought of was the importance and benefits of a design system in UX workflow. To convince teammates why a design system is crucial, I would start by explaining how a design system can streamline a design process, ensure consistency, and save time. By creating multiple types of design systems at Studyportals, they were able to save time with a Master Library, which provides all the essential UI elements for designers. However, the reading also stated, “Throughout the creation of the design system, it became evident that a design system is never truly complete” (Maghsoodi). In my opinion, this contradicted the main statement that a design system should save time. I believe that a design system will save time for future purposes but it is an investment that a team must make. Overall, a design system could be related to organizing a room, as it will take time now and in the future to keep the organization system however, it will save time when looking for items.

In addition to the Studyportals case, using Storybook could be considered a design system. When I think about a design system, I envision a comprehensive framework that includes guidelines, components, and patterns to maintain consistency and efficiency in our UX design process. Storybook aligns with this vision in several ways. By exploring examples of other Storybooks, I think it showcases UI components effectively, making it easier for teams to use. The interactive interface provides a visual representation of design elements which enables users to view and test each component in isolation, which is a fundamental aspect of a design system. While reading, I came across the quote, “It is an ongoing effort that requires regular maintenance, revision, and updates” (Maghsoodi). I related this statement with the use of Storybook and GitHub repositories as I believe it could be considered a design system through its ability to track changes, updates, and improvements in real time. 

One concept that I did not agree with was the idea of design system ownership. The reading stated that one individual should be responsible for maintaining and updating the system. However, I argue that multiple people should have access and be in charge of the system. For instance, if one employee leaves a company that was a design system owner, the company will have issues with replacing a new employee with the same knowledge. Overall, I found this reading useful for those looking to improve the user experience of their product and why design systems are necessary. I have implemented my own similar design system for school using Notion to organize tasks, readings, and assignments.
