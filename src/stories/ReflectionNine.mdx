## How to build a design system in Figma

### Aliyah Ishmail 

After delving into an article titled "A Design System for Everyone on the Team," I found that the article/site explores the concept of design systems and how they can benefit cross-functional teams. One of the key agreements I found in the article is the value of design systems in promoting consistency and efficiency. It emphasizes how a well-structured design system can provide a unified and cohesive design language, enabling different team members to work seamlessly together. As a student, this aligns with the core principles of UX design, emphasizing the importance of creating a consistent and user-friendly experience across various touchpoints. On the flip side, a point of disagreement I had was when considering the constraints of using a tool like Figma. While it's a powerful platform for collaborative design, some designers argue that it might limit creativity, especially for those who prefer to work with a broader range of design tools. As a student, this debate highlights the importance of flexibility in one's skill set and the need to be proficient in a variety of design tools to adapt to different project requirements. This can be applied to other tools such as the Adobe Creative Cloud applications. 

Relating this to my educational journey, this article provides a valuable perspective on the practical application of design systems. It underscores the importance of learning how to create and implement design systems, which will certainly be a critical skill in my future career. It also hints at the potential of using Figma as a tool for collaborative work, which might be worth exploring further in my coursework with my friends. However, some limitations include potential privacy concerns and the subscription-based pricing model. These aspects can be disadvantages, especially for students on a tight budget, and they might need to explore alternative tools for their design work. The ability to use Figma for free using our Laurier email is a nice benefit! 

Figma's component system is a powerful tool for UX developers creating design systems. You can create and manage design elements as reusable components, such as buttons, navigation bars, or icons. This approach simplifies the process of maintaining consistency and makes it easy to update design elements across an entire project, reducing the risk of discrepancies. In conclusion, this article sheds light on the significance of design systems and their role in collaborative design work. As a UX student, it reinforces the importance of learning the concept of design systems, while also encouraging a critical evaluation of tools like Figma, considering their advantages and disadvantages. Incorporating design systems into my education and future career will be beneficial, but it's crucial to keep an open mind.
