## Component Driven Development

In the article, "Building a Sketch Design System: Tips & Tricks," Stefan Ivanov provides valuable insights into the world of sketch design systems. As a UX student, I found the article to be a compelling resource that both resonated with my studies and offered fresh perspectives on the subject. I found myself in agreement with Ivanov's emphasis on the importance of maintaining consistency within a design system. This aspect is particularly relevant to the field of User Experience Design, where a consistent user interface plays a pivotal role in enhancing user satisfaction and usability. As a student, this reinforced the significance of adhering to established design principles and guidelines when working on projects.

However, I also identified areas of disagreement with the article. For instance, Ivanov highlighted Sketch as a prominent tool for design system creation. While Sketch is undoubtedly a powerful application, it's crucial to acknowledge that the software landscape is constantly evolving. There are alternative tools available, and as a UX student, it's important to remain open to exploring different platforms to adapt to the ever-changing industry. In addition, Sketch is only available for software download on Mac OS devices. This limiting constraint makes it all for all users to access. In terms of opportunities for my education, Ivanov's article introduced me to various tips and tricks for optimizing design systems within Sketch. These practical insights are beneficial for enhancing my design skills and contributing to the development of effective design systems during my studies. Implementing these techniques in projects at school can help me stand out as a proficient UX developer. This can apply to the case studies shown in my portfolio. 

Ivanov's article didn't delve into the potential disadvantages of relying solely on Sketch for design system development. Such a focus might limit the scope of one's abilities, which is a significant consideration, especially in a constantly evolving field like UX design. Lastly, the article underlines the role of design systems in the development of user experiences. It emphasizes how they serve as a tool for consistency, efficiency, and scalability in design projects. From a UX developer's perspective, this reiterates the importance of adopting a systematic approach to design, which is a valuable lesson for both my academic and professional journey. In conclusion, Stefan's article on building a Sketch design system offered valuable insights and perspectives for a UX student like me. While I agreed with the emphasis on consistency and practical tips, I also acknowledged the need to remain adaptable and open to alternative tools.
